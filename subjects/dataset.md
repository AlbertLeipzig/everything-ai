# Dataset

_A Dataset is a set of data, typically organized in tables, arrays or specific formats, such as CSV or JSON, grouped into a collection with which developers can work to meet their goals_

## Types of Datasets

- **Bivariate Dataset**: In this dataset, 2 classes or features are directly correlated to each other. For example, height and weight in a dataset are directly related to each other.

- **Categorical Dataset**: These include categories such as colour, gender, occupation, games, sports and so on.

- **File-Based Datasets**: These datasets are stored in files, in Excel as .csv, or .xlsx files.

- **Image Dataset**: It includes a dataset consisting of images. This is mostly used to differentiate the types of diseases, heart conditions and so on.

- **Multivariate Dataset**: In these types of datasets, as the name suggests 2 or more classes are directly correlated to each other. For example, attendance, and assignment grades are directly correlated to a studentpla's overall grade.

- **Numerical Dataset**: They include numerical data points that can be solved with equations. These include temperature, humidity, marks and so on.

- **Ordered Dataset**: These datasets contain data that are ordered in ranks, for example, customer reviews, movie ratings and so on.

- **Partitioned Dataset**: These datasets have data points segregated into different members or different partitions.

- **Time series Dataset**: These include datasets between a period, for example, changes in geographical terrain over time.

- **Web Dataset**: These include datasets created by calling APIs using HTTP requests and populating them with values for data analysis. These are mostly stored in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) formats.

## Main Characteristics

- Variables represent the specific attributes or characteristics being studied within the dataset. For example, in a sales dataset, variables might include product ID, price and purchase date. Variables often serve as inputs for machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis.

- Schemas define a dataset's structure, including the relationships and syntax between its variables. For example, a tabular dataset's schema might outline the dataset's formats and column headers, such as "date," "amount" and "category." A JSON schema might describe nested data structures such as customer profiles with attributes such as "name," "email" and an array of "order history" objects.

-Metadata or data about data, provides essential context about the dataset, including details about its origin, purpose and usage guidelines. This information helps ensure that datasets remain interpretable and integrate effectively with other systems.

## Properties of Dataset

- **Center of data**: This refers to the "middle" value of the data, often measured by mean, median, or mode. It helps understand where most of the data points are concentrated.

- **Correlation among the data**: This refers to the strength and direction of relationships between different variables in the dataset. A positive correlation indicates values in one variable tend to increase as the other does, while a negative correlation suggests they move in opposite directions. No correlation means there's no linear relationship between the variables.

- **Presence of outliers**: These are data points that fall significantly outside the overall pattern. Identifying outliers can be important as they might influence analysis results and require further investigation.

- **Skewness of data**: This indicates how symmetrical the data distribution is. A perfectly symmetrical distribution (like a normal distribution) has a skewness of 0. Positive skewness means the data is clustered towards the left, while negative skewness means it's clustered towards the right.

- **Spread among data members**: This describes how much the data points vary from the center. Common measures include standard deviation or variance, which quantify how far individual points deviate from the average.

- **Type of probability distribution** that the data follows: Understanding the distribution (e.g., normal, uniform, binomial) helps us predict how likely it is to find certain values within the data and choose appropriate statistical methods for analysis.

## Features of a Dataset

- **Categorical Features**: These include multiple classes/ categories, such as gender, colour, and so on.

- **Data Entries**: These refer to the individual values of data present in the Dataset. They play a huge role in data analysis.

- **Formatting of Data**: The datasets available online are available in several formats. Some of them are JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), CSV (Comma Separated Value), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), DataFrame, and Excel Files (xlsx or xlsm). For particularly large datasets, especially involving images for disease detection, while downloading the files from the internet, it comes in zip files which will be needed to extract in the system to individual components.

- **Metadata**: Includes a general description of a dataset. Generally in very large datasets, having an idea/ description of the dataset when it's transferred to a new developer will save a lot of time and improve efficiency.

- **Numerical Features**: These may include numerical values such as height, weight, and so on. These may be continuous over an interval, or discrete variables.

- **Size of the Data**: It refers to the number of entries and features it contains in the file containing the Dataset.

- **Target Variable**: It is the feature whose values/attributes are referred to to get outputs from the other features with machine learning techniques.

## The Process of Data Analysis

1. **Define Objectives**: Set clear goals and identify the key questions our analysis should answer. Understand what insights or decisions the data will guide.

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant information from reliable sources. Ensure data is complete, accurate and well-organized. Data can be qualitative (descriptions) or quantitative (numbers).

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Fix errors, handle missing values and deal with outliers. Prepare the data in a format suitable for accurate analysis.

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the data with visuals and summary statistics to spot patterns, trends and anomalies. This step helps refine our approach.

1. **Statistical Analysis**: Apply statistical methods or models to test ideas, find relationships and make predictions that answer our original questions.

1. **Visualization & Communication**: Present findings through charts, dashboards or reports. Share insights clearly so stakeholders can make informed decisions.

## Types of Data Analysis

- **Descriptive Analysis**: Focuses on summarizing historical data to understand past events and trends. It provides a clear picture of what has happened through reports, charts and key metrics.

- **Diagnostic Analysis**: Explores data in greater depth to determine why certain outcomes occurred. It identifies causes, correlations and contributing factors behind observed patterns.

- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses statistical models and historical data to forecast what is likely to happen in the future. It supports planning by anticipating trends, risks or opportunities.

- **Prescriptive Analysis**: Builds on predictive insights by recommending what actions should be taken. It provides data-driven strategies and solutions to optimize decision-making.
